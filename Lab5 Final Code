#This program will show the total amount of bottles that have been collected over 7 days. The end result will print the number of bottles as well as the payout amount. User will be able to use the program multiple times with different inputs.

#Declare variables below
total_bottles=0 
counter=1
today_bottles=0
total_payout=0.0
keep_going="y"

#Loop to run the program again
while keep_going=="y":
    total_bottles=0
    counter=1
    while counter <=7: #This is a part of the while loop and the program will keep executing this as long as it is true.
        today_bottles=int(input(f"Enter number of bottles for day #{counter}:  ")) #This prompts the user to input number of bottles.
        total_bottles+=today_bottles
        counter+=1
    total_payout=total_bottles*0.10

#Adding print statements below
    print(f"The total number of bottles collected is {total_bottles}") 
    print(f"The total paid out is $ {total_payout:.1f}") #This will print the payout dollar amount
    print("Do you want to enter another week's worth of data?")
    print("Enter y or n")
    keep_going=input() #This will allow the user to enter a fresh set of inputs
